   <li>Freidrich Nietzsche
        <ul>
            
Friedrich Nietzsche (1844â€“1900), a German philosopher and cultural critic, is renowned for his bold critiques of European morality and conventional ideas during the late 19th century. Often associated with a "hermeneutics of suspicion" akin to Marx and Freud, Nietzsche used psychological analyses to expose false consciousness in societal beliefs. Beyond critique, he formulated original theories about the self and proposed new values for cultural renewal and enhanced well-being. His work challenges traditional norms and continues to influence philosophical and cultural perspectives.
